Authentication and whitelisting solution for Bitlegend. Built from the ground up for Minecraft/Bukkit 1.2.x (with planned updates as long as Bitlegend hosts a server). We needed a simple, easy to manage solution for authentication due to the pirate-friendly nature of our server. After having no luck with popular authentication plugins (the update cycles at the time were ridiculously long - as you would expect from significantly more complex plugins) I decided to write one for us. I wanted to create an easy to use and lightweight authentication plugin for Minecraft/Bukkit and that's exactly what I have done.
