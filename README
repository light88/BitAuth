Authorization and whitelisting solution for Bitlegend. Built from the ground up for Minecraft/Bukkit 1.2.3. We needed a simply, easy to manage solution for authorization due to the pirate-friendly nature of our server. After having no luck with popular authorization plugins (the update cycles are ridiculously long - as you would expect from significantly more complex plugins), I decided to write our own. I wanted to create a simple, easy to use and lightweight authorization plugin, and that's exactly what I've done.

Things to be done:
	* Permission handling and nodes
	* Login and registration time limits (e.g. 2 minutes then kicked)
	* Set up a password reset system

		(tinyint), lastlogintime (bigint), ipaddress (bigint), enableipcheck
		(tinyint), pwreset (tinyint), temppwd (blob), tmpsalt (blob)
Whitelist table:
	Columns: username (text), enabled (tinyint)
